# My portfolio as Software Manual Tester
# Who am I? 🧐
Hello! 👋  
My name is Izabela Przeniosło.  
After graduating from high school, I started my adventure with technology by buying parts and assembling my first computer.  
I continued learning on my own by working in different repair shops where I learned how to repair devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, headphones, wearable devices and computer accessories.  
I also worked as a QA, responsible for checking phone PCBs after refurbishment.  
In the meantime, I also started studying Computer Science with a specialisation in PHP and Magento. Unfortunately, due to personal reasons, I had to interrupt my studies at the beginning of the 3rd year.  
Shortly after, I met a friend who had been working as a tester for a few years and he introduced me to this world.  
Thanks to this friendship, I decided that I wanted to develop in this direction and dedicate my future to software testing.☺
